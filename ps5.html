    <h1>History:</h1>
    <p>PlayStation5 released on November 12, 2020. The strongest home console to date, the PlayStation 5 or the PS5, is a grand achievement from 
      Sony. The most recent system from Sony, the PS5 is a major step into the future of technology. With the 825 GB of storage, the PS5 promised 
      PlayStation users a new way to experience gaming. With two versions of the consoles releasing on day one, there is the digital download version, which
      eliminated CD usage by only allowing the console to only process digitally downloaded games. The PS5 sold out in the 
      first day that it released, huge demands were made for this console having many people struggling to receive  one with how much praise 
      the console was receiving. The console isn't even half way done with its life span, and it already has garnered several elite games
      best to play on the PS5. The PS5 still has several years left in its life, and it looks to be a very promising set of years.
