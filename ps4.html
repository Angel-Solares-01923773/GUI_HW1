      console. Although, with the coming of the PS4, it promised the strongest console to date, all new hardware and a huge jump in 
      graphics, and with all these promises, Sony delivered. The PS4 gave users an incredibly fast experience, with seamless online play,
      and an unrivaled catalog of games. The PS4 seemed to set a new point in gaming, pushing the bar of amazing visuals, and immersive gaming 
      experiences with the amazing sound design. Multiplayer expanded into something much more during this age of PlayStation, almost making online
      play with other friends a necessity for every game.The PS4 delivered on every level and left people satisfied for the years up till the road to the 
      PS5.
