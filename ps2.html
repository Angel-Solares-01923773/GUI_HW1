    <h1>History:</h1>
    <p>The PlayStation2 was released in March 4, 2000, and to many people, this was a long awaited console.
      Of course the PS2 (PlayStation 2) had a lot to live up to following its predecessor, now looking back at the 
    long legacy of consoles Sony has created, people still claim the PS2 to be the greatest accomplishment of them all.
      Although, hearing about a system able to run DVDs and to be able to access the internet doesn't sound like much
      compared to modern day standards, during the PS2s era, this had never been seen until the PS2 released. The PlayStation 2
      continued with its grand titles already established from its predecessor, it furthered gaming with much improved graphics,
      and hardware that outrivaled anything on the market. Along with the plentitude of new titles, PS2 also had 
      backwards compatibility, making it able to play any games from the PlayStation 1 only solidifying how useful
      this console could be.
